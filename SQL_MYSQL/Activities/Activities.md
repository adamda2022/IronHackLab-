## Activity ERD

Suppose you are given the following requirements for a simple database for the National Hockey League (NHL):
+ the NHL has many teams,
+ each team has a name, a city, a coach, a captain, and a set of players,
+ each player belongs to only one team,
+ each player has a name, a position (such as left wingor goalie), a skill level, and a set of injury records,
+ a team captain is also a player,
+ a game is played between two teams (referred to as host_team and guest_team) and has a date (such as May 11th, 2017) and a score (such as 4 to 2).


Please construct clean ERD Diagram for the NHL database.
